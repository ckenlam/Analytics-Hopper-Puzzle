Cracking the Hopper Data Puzzle provided on their career page. 

I stumpled upon this data-puzzle provided by Hopper Inc. on their career page for applicants who wish to apply for their Data Scientist position.

Hopper Inc. is the maker behind the flight-booking app that predicts the price of flights up to a year in advance with 95 per cent accuracy by using algorithms capable of analyzing massive amounts of data. Depending on the price of tickets when a search is made, Hopper advises users whether they should buy immediately or wait for a better price. The application will then send the user a notification when the flight is at its lowest predicted price.
